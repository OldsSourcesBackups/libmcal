MCAL HowTo- 11/19/99

Download the required Files:
	libmcal.tar.gz
	mcal-drivers.tar.gz
	
unzip and untar the files:

on linux you may perform both steps by adding the -x option

	[me@home]$ tar -xvzf libmcal.tar.gz
	[me@home]$ tar -xvzf mcal-drivers.tar.gz

Copy the driver directories into the libmcal directory:

	[me@home]$ cp mstore ./libmcal
	[me@home]$ cp icap ./libmcal
	
Enter the mstore directory
	[me@home]$ cd libmcal/mstore
Next execute make:
	[me@home]$ make
Next move to the icap directory and repeat the previos steps:
	[me@home]$ cd ../icap
Next execute make:
	[me@home]$ make

Now move into the libmcal directory and execute the configure script with the desired options:
To learn about the available options :
	[me@home]$ ./configure --help
Now to continue:
	[me@home]$ ./configure --with-mstore --with-icap
Now finish with the final compilation:
	[me@home]$ make
	
If you are planning to use these drivers with PHP 3 or 4 you will inclued the following tag in the configure schema:
	--with-mcal=../path-to-libmcal

Now you will need to create the local mstore directory:

	[me@home]$ mkdir /var/calendar
	
Next set the permissions on the new directory:
	[me@home]$ chmod 1777 /var/calendar

Happy Planning!
