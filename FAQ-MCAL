MCAL FAQ - 11/19/99
Robert Allen allenb@home-networking.org


1: I am unable to open a stream into the mstore directory what is wrong?

o Check the permissions on the calendar directory.
	To Properly set these permissions execute the following command:
	
	[me@home]$ chown -R nobody.nobody /var/calendar
	[me@home]$ chmod 1777 /var/calendar


2: How do I create a passwd file for the local mstore driver?

o Using the Apache htpasswd utility you may create the mpasswd file with the command below
	[me@home]$ htpasswd -c /etc/mpasswd username
	
	To add or update this file you would execute as follows:
	[me@home]$ htpasswd /etc/mpasswd username

	
3: How do I get support?

o Currently there is a user list that has been provided by Chek.Com for public discussion
   to subscribe send an email to: blah@chek.com


4: What is MCAL?

o The MCAL library is very similar to the c-client IMAP library. It offers a common 
   simple interface for accessing calendars that can be stored in many different 
   formats, both local and remote formats are supported. 
   
   
5: What objects can MCAL Support?

o Some of MCAL's supported object features are: 
	-Alarms (triggers) which can be set to go off any number of minutes before the event. 
	-Class values (Public/Private) 
	-Start and End Dates 
	-Recurrence (This event should re-occur every Thursday..etc..) 
	-Calendar sharing.

7: How Do I get CVS write access?

o To apply for CVS write access send an email to Mark Musone : musone@edgeglobal.com


8: What are the expandable possibilities for libmcal?

o Currently there is discussion involving concepts that would revolutionize the way dates and 
   schedules are handled on many levels.
	- Plans are being discussed to create a SQL Driver for libmcal which would enable
	  database storage of calendars.
	- Conceptual discussion is underway for the development of a "cron" aware interface
	  which in theory would allow the unix scheduling  daemon to access it's scheduled 
	  events from a icap based calendar.
	- Plans are being made to start a Perl Module for the use of libmcal.
	- Discussion for the development of a MS Outlook plugin.
	- In summary the way libmcal is designed it offers a robust means to create 
	  drivers and interface for an unlimited number of possibilities.
