mcal stands for Modular Calendar Access Library.

libmcal is a C library for accessing calendars. It's written
to be very modular, with plugable drivers.

once the library is compiled, calendar clients can be wirrten very easily.

Compilation:

To compile libmcal, you need to first have calendar drivers in place.
The calendar drivers are ina seperate package, and should be untarred
and compiled under the mail libmcal directory.

i.e.:

/home/musone/libmcal     <-- libmcal base compile directory
/home/musone/libmcal/icap   <-- icap driver for libmcal
/home/musone/libmcal/dummy  <--- dummy driver for libmcal

Once the drivers are compiled, run configure in the libmcal directory.

You should pass in --with-[DRIVERNAME] for each driver you want compiled in.

For example, in the above sample driver installation, to enable both driver:

>./configure --with-icap --with-dummy

You can also specify an alternative driver directory for each driver:

>./configure --with-icap=../drivers/icap --with-dummy=testdrivers/dummy


Once configure is run, type:


>make

libmcal.a should then be compiled.
