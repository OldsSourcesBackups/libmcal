This is the mstore driver.
It uses a local filesystem to store calendars for users.
The base directory for calendars is: "/var/calendar"
each calendar is simply named the users username.
i.e. the user john will have a /var/calendar/john file.
becuase of this, /var/calendar should be world or group writable, 
with the sticky bit turned on (like /var/spool/mail directory)
to prevent tampering.

The mstore driver also uses a file /etc/mpasswd.
this file should be world readable, and is the password file that
it uses. The password file uses the same file format as apache's
.htpasswd file. It is of the form username:encryptedpassword
The encrypted password uses the normal unix crypt function,
with the salt being the first two characters.

You can use the htpasswd program that comes with apache to
add or change a users password.
