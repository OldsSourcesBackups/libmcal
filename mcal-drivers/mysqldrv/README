This is a mcal driver for mysql.  One of the main goals in putting it together
was to keep the table arrangement in mysql as close to the ical standard as
possible to make it easier to keep to ical as new features are added to mcal
later.

To get going, create a database in MySQL called 'mcal' and create a user
account with permissions to modify that database.  Then create a calendar
with the same name as the user (you can do this by modifying tester, or soon
with php).  Currently mysqldrv is limited to only being able to access the 
calendar of the database user, but this isn't too difficult to change.

As it stands (11 May 2000) I'm having trouble compiling this in with php
from conflicts with the mysql module in php.  I'm sure this has an easy
solution, but I don't know it, so if you do, let me know.  Oh, also, right now
the Makefile is set to look for /usr/include/mysql/mcal.h and 
/usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a.  These are the default spots for the RedHat 
rpm, and probably other configurations too, but if they aren't for you then 
you just need to change a line in the Makefile and change the include for
mcal.h in mysqldrv.c
